# 📩 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The dataset is sourced **directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**, so no manual download is needed.

## 🚀 Features
- Loads dataset automatically from an online URL  
- Preprocesses text messages with **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
- Trains a **Naive Bayes classifier** for text classification  
- Evaluates model with **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Report**
